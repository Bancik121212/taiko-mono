# Run a Sepolia node

This guide will help you get a Sepolia archive node up and running.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed and **running**.
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git/) is installed.
- As of `2023-06-21` a full archive node sync takes **326 GB** with geth + lighthouse. Consult the hardware requirements of the execution + consensus clients you are using.

## Steps

<Steps>
### Clone eth-docker
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker
cd eth-docker
```

### Enable archive mode

First, copy `default.env` to `.env`:

```
cp default.env .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and set:

```filename=e
ARCHIVE_NODE=true
```

### Expose RPC ports

You need to expose the node's RPC ports so that the Taiko L2 node can make calls to it. eth-docker offers a few options that you can read about [here](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/Advanced#sharing-rpc-and-rest-ports).

An easy option is to append `el-shared.yml` to the list of files set with the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in the `.env` file. Keep in mind this is **not encrypted**, so you should not expose it to the internet.

### Complete the eth-docker quickstart

Complete the [eth-docker quickstart](https://eth-docker.net/Usage/QuickStart/). You will need to run the config command:

```sh
./ethd config
```

### Check your connection

You can do a simple curl command to check if the node is synced (change port from `8545` to whatever you have the execution client p2p port set to in your `.env` file):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":0}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
```



<Callout type="warning">
If you get the following error after running the curl command above to test your Execution Layer client's connection to request the latest Sepolia block
```bash
curl: (7) failed to connect to localhost port 8545 after 0 ms: connection refused
```
check that your Execution Layer client ports 
are setup by adding `el-shared.yml` to the list of files set with the `COMPOSE_FILE` variable in the `.env` file as mentioned in step `Expose RPC ports`.

For example, your `COMPOSE_FILE` flag in your `.env` file should look something like 
```bash
COMPOSE_FILE=lighthouse-cl-only.yml:geth.yml:el-shared.yml
```

</Callout>

### Harden your network (optional)

This is important especially if you `ssh` into machine or open ports to the internet (be careful about that). Here are some recommended resources:
